/* 
 * Task 1.2
 *
 * Write a C program that reads a year from the user and determines whether it is a leap year.
 *
 * A year is a leap year if:
 * - It is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100
 *	OR
 * - It is divisible by 400
 *
 * Input
 * - An integer representing a year (e.g., 2024)
 * 
 * Output
 * - Print "Leap Year" if the year is a leap year
 * - Otherwise, print "Not a Leap Year"
 *
